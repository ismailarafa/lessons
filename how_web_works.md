The Internet is a network of computers, with unanimous protocols that dictate the manner in which communication is carried out. For transfer of large data, it is broken down into fragments called packets, which have instructions and details about their recipient and sender. IP addresses are assigned to computers (either servers or clients) in a network, and can be accessed by a domain name server (i.e an address book). Packets are transmitted through routers, and upon reaching their destination, the packets' instructions enable the data fragments to be reassembled to its designated form.

A client computer is a computer connected indirectly to the Internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP)
A web page is a page displayed on a web browser.
A website is a collection of web pages linked together.
A computer that hosts a website on the Internet is a web server.
Websites that help you find other web pages is a search engine.
DNS servers are a large address book that help determine which server a website lives on through sending a DNS request.

Typing google.com into a browser makes the browser check the DNS cache for the domain name's IP address, and upon identifying it, makes a request. If the web server accepts said request, it sends data packets through routers to my client computer, which enables the packets to reassemble to display a copy of the website. Upon clicking search on google, my client computer sends data packets to the web server to make a request to look up web pages including the search query. If the request is granted, the web server sends a copy of the web page with the search results as data packets through routers, which are then compiled at their destination according to the instructions contained in the packets.
