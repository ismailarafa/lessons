HTML and CSS are separated to have the structural/content elements (i.e HTML) in a standalone file than the styling elements (i.e CSS) which has its own sheet. This is done to avoid code duplication, having the ability to change styling without touching the content, and reduce bandwidth usage.

ID's and Classes are selectors to identify specific HTML tags or portions of content. Multiple elements can have the same class, whereas ID's are unique to one only. In CSS, ID's are prefixed with a "#", while Classes are prefixed with a "." Both are considered HTML attributes.

An HTML element is usually initiated with a start tag and terminated with an end tag, the tags combined with the content in between them make an HTML element.

An HTML tag is a string within "<>" which signifies an HTML element, telling the browser for example that this "<p>" should be displayed as a block of text.

An HTML attribute provides additional information about any element, always specified in the start tag, and usually comes in pairs "name=value". Examples are "alt, href, id, src, style, title"

HTML form is an element that defines a form used to collect user input.

A <div> tag is used as way to divide the HTML document into specific sections.

A CSS selector is an HTML element that is specified before "{}" to signify that it's being styled.

A CSS property is a styling property assigned to a selector, and has a value entailing the styling to be done on the selector. (ex: div {border-radius: 25px 25px 0 0})

A CSS value is a characteristic that follows a property to indicate its styling effect on the selector, and subsequently the HTML element.

A URL query string is a part of the URL which contains data that doesn't fit into a hierarchical path structure, it specifies a location on the URL requested by the browser to visit on the respective web server.

Pixels are fixed units measured by the pixel-count relative to a screen, whereas ems are a scalable unit that is relative to font size making it a more flexible font unit.

Inheritance of properties is the mechanism where certain properties are passed to children elements from their parent elements. Inherited properties include font-family, font-size, color, etc...However, not all properties are inherited such as margins.

Two CSS attributes which can be used to push around elements on a page are position and float.

The three ways to insert CSS into a project are through external style sheet (a separate and linked CSS stylesheet), an internal style sheet (within the HTML file) and inline style (adding style attributes to HTML tags and elements)

A User Agent Stylesheet is a default stylesheet within a browser which will display documents in a legible manner.

A CSS reset is a compressed set of CSS rules which reset the styling of all HTML elements to a ubiquitous baseline.
