# What is the basic **list** syntax?
>There are three types of **lists**, _ordered_, **unorderered** and **_description lists_**. The former is annotated by the ````<ol>```` _tag_, the second by the ````<ul>```` _tag_, and the third by the ````<dl>```` _tag_. The first two's _syntax_ is pretty similar as the _child elements_ for both are ````<li>```` _tags_, which defines a line in either types of **lists**. A **_description list_** written as ````<dl>```` has a _different syntax_, it has a ````<dt>```` _element_ which defines a description term _element_ and has to precede the ````<dd>```` _element_ which provides the description for the description term element. Both ````<dt>```` and ````<dd>```` _elements_ are displayed as **block elements**.

> ## How do you _nest_ **lists** inside each other?
**Lists** can be infinitely _nested_ into each other by opening a new **list** _element_ within an ````<li>```` _element_ already existing in a parent **list** _element_. The entire **list** _element nested_ within another **list** (including all of its _child elements_) **HAS** to be _all_ within a single ````<li>```` _element_.
