There are three types of lists, ordered, unorderered and description lists. The former is annotated by the <ol> tag, the second by the <ul> tag, and the third by the <dl> tag. The first two's syntax is pretty similar as the child elements for both are <li> tags, which defines a line in either types of lists. A description list written as <dl> has a different syntax, it has a <dt> element which defines a description term element and has to precede the <dd> element which provides the description for the description term element. Both <dt> and <dd> elements are displayed as block elements.

Lists can be infinitely nested into each other by opening a new list element within an <li> element already existing in a parent list element. The entire list element nested within another list (including all of its child elements) HAS to be all within a single <li> element.
