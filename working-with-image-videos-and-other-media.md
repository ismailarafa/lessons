Common attributes of an <img> tag include the src attribute which defines the absolute or relative path where the image is, and the alt attribute which is a highly descriptive text for accessibility purposes. Moreover, height and width are common attributes as well in order to ensure the image renders properly on the page.
You can fill up an element with an image using the width attribute, and in turn setting it to 100%.
You can load a smaller version of the image through converting its format to a more compressed and smaller one.
To optimize load times, the appropriate image formats and sizes must be used in their respective applications. JPG's should be used when displaying product photos, portraits, and other images where color variance is crucial. Their type of compression is one that made the image smaller by taking out color elements invisible to the human eye.
GIFs should be used when displaying logos and graphs, or for images where transparency is of importance, they shouldn't be used for images where color variance is important because GIFs are only limited to 256 colors.
PNGs were created as an alternative to GIFs with 5-25% greater compression. On top of supporting transparency, its degree can also be tweaked by users. They also load twice as fast as GIFs, they are usually used to display logos.
SVG are impervious to loss of quality when their sizes are increased, as opposed to JPGs who's quality severely deteriorates in case of extreme enlargement. SVGs are vector-based instead of rasters who're pixel-based. SVGs also support animation but only on a 2D plane.
GIFs and PNGs both use transparent colors with varying degrees, with the latter having the ability for users to control its degree.
GIFs and SVGs both support animation, although SVGs can only support two-dimensional animation.
Images should be stored externally if they're too big, not as relevant to the content, and is borrowed from somewhere else. Whilst the more relevant and important images should be stored on the server.
JPG is the best format for photos due to its infinite color variance, making it display photos with almost perfect color variance.
GIFs and PNGs are the best formats to display graphics due to color variance not being of crucial importance, and them supporting transparency.
SVGs let you scale an image as big as it can without detracting from the quality, since it is vector-based as opposed to other image formats, which are rasters. Vector-based images are much simpler in that instead of 300 dots per inch of colors (as with JPGs) in such small spaces, SVGs are composed mathematically as opposed to chromatically, in that they are just a mathematical equation with 4 points instead of potentially thousands.
Raster images are composed of colored pixels, making them more meticulously composed, more chromatically malleable, and have greater color variance. On the other hand, vector images are composed of a mathematical equation which specifies start points where the shape takes place, hence why when enlarged, it maintains the quality and isn't blurry. Whereas with a JPG, when enlarged, the computer approximates the additional pixels and their colors since it's impossible for it to precisely determine the exact shades of colors of the image.
You can add audio or video to a page using either the <audio> or the <video> tags and specifying its "src" attribute, or elsewhere using a <source> tag with either an absolute or relative path. The <video>/<audio> tags must have a Boolean attribute (of no value) of either controls, loop, or autoplay. Autoplay plays the audio/video upon launching the page, loop as you can guess loops the content infinitely, and finally controls adds a seeker, time, a pause/play button and volume controls that are defaulted in your browser.
