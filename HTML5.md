HTML5 introduced a new structure to its documents, within the <body> live a number of block elements, a <header> come first nestled at the top of the page, usually including navigation, a heading, etc...A <nav> element usually exists within a <header> element, and should include hyperlinks to other pages, table of contents. The <article> element identifies independent transferrable content that maybe reused or shared. Moreover, the <section> element generally includes a heading, the content is likely generic and is used to provide hierarchy within the page. <aside> element is a block holding content such as sidebars that is
auxiliary to the information on the page, it appears usually on the sides of a page. Finally, a <footer> element usually located at the bottom of its parent identifies the closing block of page.

Element attributes, placed in opening HTML tags, are used to define a characteristic to an element such as id, class, identifying either an element or a class of elements respectively. Class selectors should be used as when targeting multiple elements, while ID selectors should be used when specifically targeting one element to apply styles to.

CSS should always live on an external style sheet linked from the HTML page, to ensure smoother performance and save a lot of heartache for users and everybody.

Attributes for images should include a highly descriptive text of the image displayed. Should the image be irrelevant, the value of the alt attribute should be left blank so that screen readers ignore it instead of reading the image file name. Additionally, if an image is highly irrelevant, it should be included as a CSS background image rather than an <img> element.
