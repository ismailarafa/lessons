# What are **data structures**, _arrays_, **_objects_** and _properties_?

**Data structures** are a more complex **variable** that enable a _program_ to grasp more sophisticated _data_. _Arrays_ are the first kind of **data structure** written between [] with its elements separated with , _Array_ elements are automatically indexed starting from 0\. An _array_ is essentially a list of **variables** for _data_ to be more effectively grasped by _programs_. _Arrays_ have both _properties_ and **methods**. Their _properties_ range from .length to any, and their **methods** include **.push()**, to add elements at the end of the _array_, **.pop()**, which removes the last element of an _array_. There's also **.join method** which displays an _array_ without the separating commas. Moreover, **_objects_** are another kind of **data structure**. They're written between {} and each **_object_** has its custom _properties_. All values have _properties_ which determine a characteristic of a value. (ex: myWord.length, Math.min, etc...)
