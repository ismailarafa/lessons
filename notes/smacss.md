# What is **SMACSS** and are **CSS rules** categorized?

**SMACSS** is short for scalable and modular architecture for **CSS**. **CSS rules** in **SMACSS** are in 5 categories, **base**, _layout_, **_module_**, _state_ and **theme**. **Base rules** are defaults, they often consist of single element _selectors_, but they can include _attribute selectors, pseudo-class, child and sibling selectors_. In short, **base styles** entail that wherever the place of an element, its styling is according to its **base styles**. _Layout rules_ divide the page into sections, holding one or more **_modules_**. **_Modules rules_** are the reusable modular parts of the design. Examples are callouts, sidebar sections, products lists, etc... _State rules_ describe how the **_modules_** or _layouts_ look in a particular state, like hidden, expanded, active, inactive, on different screen sizes, they also style **_modules_** if they look different on different pages. **Theme rules** are like _state rules_ in that they describe how **_modules_** or _layouts_ look but they are not necessary by most sites.
