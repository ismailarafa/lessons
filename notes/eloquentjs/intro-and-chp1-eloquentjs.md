# What is **JavaScript**?

**JavaScript's** creation happened in 1995 to add _programs_ to browsers. It's the most ubiquitous language in that it's compatible with almost all _browsers_ and has a plethora of applications. It adds interactivity and is the final component of the **front-end**. It's standardized by the ECMAScript standard, and ECMAScript is interchangeable with **JavaScript** when referring to it. It also has _back-end_ and _server-side programming_ applications such as **Node.js** among others.

## What are **values** and what are their _types_?

**Values** are data stored on the computer's memory. At the core of it, **values** are _bits_ in a computer's **data storage**. They have different types, which are _number_ denoting a _number_ and looks like **15**. A **Float** is also a _number_ but it's a _number_ with _decimal places_, an example would be _'3.1424982498'_. Moreover, another kind of **values** are _strings_ which are a string of words enclosed within either single or double quotation marks as long as they match on either end of the _string_. Moreover, the last kind of **values** are **Boolean**, and that entails that it can be equal to either _true_ or _false_.

## What are **operators** and what are their _types_?

**Operators** are symbols which enable **JavaScript** to perform operations. The most simple **operators** are **arithmetic operators**, which include _+_, _-_, _*_, _/_, _%_. You can also concatenate _strings_ using the _+_ **operator**. Moreover, there are **comparison operators** which used in _expressions_ to compare **values**, they range from _==_, _!=_, _===_, _!=_, _<_, _>_, _<=_, _>=_. And lastly **logic operators** like _&&_ (**both values**), and || (_either or values_), beyond **binary operators**. _Unary operators_ like - and ! negate numerically and logically respectively, and also the _typeof_ used to find a **value's** _type. Lastly, there's also a **ternary operator** that looks like_ ?:_ which picks one of two **values** based on a third **value**.

### What is **type coercion** and how does it work?

When faced with different types of _values_, **JavaScript** converts or _coerces_ the types based on a set of rules in the **API**.
