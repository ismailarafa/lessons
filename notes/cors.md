# What is **CORS**, why does it exists and how to get around it?

**CORS** works around the same-origin policy, which protects servers from malicious requests. It's short for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. The same-origin policy prevents scripts from one website inserting themselves onto another. It's a somewhat strict policy, so there are ways to get around it like _JSON-P_. Depending on the **API** used, by referring to the documentation you can determine whether to use **CORS** or _JSON-P_.
