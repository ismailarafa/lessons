# What are **http status codes**?

**Status codes** are the responses given by a server to an **http request**. `301` means the document has moved permanently when making `GET` request and would have to redirect, while `200` means that it's found and the request was successful in its retrieval. **Status code** `404`, the most infamous entails that the document requested was not found. `415` means that the content type requested is not supported, for example if a `GET` request asks for a **JSON** file in `HTML`, it will return a `415` **status code**. Making `POST` request, a `201` **status code** returns when data is properly posted on the server. Moreover, when an invalid content type header is in a `POST` request and the server cannot parse it, a `400` **status code** comes back meaning a `Bad Request` error. `202` **status code** means the server has responded to the `POST` request with an accepted **status code**, meaning the request is processing asynchronously. `204` **status code** is another success code and it means no content, the result of a `GET` request that checks if the requested data is available. `206` also comes into play with `GET` requests and comes back when a client request a part of a binary file like some bytes from an image. It returns the message `Partial Content`. When using a `POST` request to a location that has moved, a `307` **status code** returns with the message `Temporary Redirect` and a Location header like a `301` **status code**. `304` **status code** returns when a request checks to see if the data on the server is the same as its last version in cache by passing the cache's ETag header as an argument on the CLI tool used, its message is `Not Modified`. The `200's` **status codes** outline a positive server response, while the `300's` **status codes** outline that the requested data's location has moved, and the `400's` **status codes** outline a user error. `422` **status code** returns when a request misses one or more of the required fields, it returns `Unprocessable Entity` message. `401 Unauthorized` **status code** returns when a user requires authentication for a request and does not provide it. `403 Forbidden` returns when a forbidden use of the _API_ takes place in a request, it could be that the user does not have necessary permissions or otherwise. The `500's` **status codes** outline server errors, they concern backend problems and changes to the request will not solve it unlike the `400's` **status code**. `500 Internal Server Error` happens when there is a problem on the server side despite a valid request. `503 Service Unavailable` returns when a server is processing a lot requests or otherwise unavailable.
