# Where does _CSS_ come from?

_CSS_ comes from 1996 when the specification saw the light. In the same year, IE3 also saw the light and was the first browser to support _CSS_. _CSS_ comes from the **W3C**, which standardize specs. After working drafts are available, support for it by the web community helps influence standardization and development of them until implementation. In other words, _CSS_ comes from the web community.

## How can _CSS_ variables and **JS** be useful?

By using **JS** to build an observable that subscribes to value changes combined with _CSS_ variables, you can separate the presentational aspect from **JS** and use the functional part to update the presentational values with an observable that subscribes to values updated by user input.
