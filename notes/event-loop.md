# What is the **event loop** in **JavaScript**?

**JavaScript** consists of a _call stack_, an **event loop**, a **_callback queue_** and other _API's_. Those _API's_ include the **DOM**, `setTimeout` and **Ajax** requests. Since the way **JavaScript** works in a single-threaded manner, meaning that as _functions_ initialize in a program, they're added to a _call stack_, which then proceeds to empty the stack one call at a time. This process is _synchronous_, whereas an **asynchronous** or _concurrent_ approach would differ. _Synchronous_ approaches often freeze the page from anything as it empties the stack if a _callback_ takes too long, also known as _blocking_. An **asynchronous** approach often using `setTimeout` works rather differently. When the program encounters a `setTimeout` call and adds it on the stack, it then starts its counter, removes it from the _call stack_ proceeds up the stack, and queue the `setTimeout` _callback's_ body on the **_callback queue_**. _Functions_ in the **_callback queue_** wait to executed when the **event loop** adds them to the stack solely when the _call stack_ is empty. Meaning that the `setTimeout` value is the least delay time it will to execute, which could be longer depending on how long it takes to empty the _call stack_.
