# Why are code comments crucial to design?

Code comments often lead to better system design as they
document the code in place. Comments are a kind of documentation
that helps with hiding complexity and thus ameloriates the design.

# What are the four excuses for not writing comments?

Developers often make four excuses for not writing comments,
and they are good code is self-documenting, I don't have time
to write comments, comments become misleading when they go out of date,
and that comments have little to no value. If a user has to read
a method's implementation to use it, then it has no abstraction since
all of the method's complexity is exposed.

# What are the benefits of well-written comments?

The main benefit of code comments is to express design ideas that
cannot be easily expressed in code. Comments can usually mediate both
cognitive load and unknown unknowns by giving developers some guidance
on the software's structure.
