# How do you think about performance?

Pre-optimizing often delays development and slows down
the process, while simultaneously not accounting for
performant solutions could adversely affect the system's
performance. Benchmarking performance is the best way to find
bottlenecks and evaluate the need for optimizations as well as
providing a baseline to re-measure performance after optimizations.

# Why are fundamental changes good optimizations?

Caching is an example of a fundamental change and it reflects
the optimization philosophy of designing around the critical path.
Changing an algorithm is another example of fundamental change.
Sometimes fundamental fixes don't exist, which would entail
refactoring of the solution by minimizing the code only to
what's needed for the critical path.
