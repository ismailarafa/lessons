# What's the primary purpose of code comments?

Comments describe things that are not obviously deduced from the code.
They can refer to low-level software or hardware details, high level
description of an interface or implementation. Comments should provide
information than provided by the code in different detail. Comments
clarifying lower level information add precision, while higher level
comments add intuition. The former is most useful with data structure
member comments. (i.e unit of measurement for a data member)

# What are the kinds of comments?

Comments fall into four categories and they are interface comments,
which precede the module and describe its interface. Second, data structure
member comments refer to comments written next to a field declaration in
a data structure. Third, implementation comments referring to comments that
describe how an implementation works in a function or more specifically what
it actually does and why. And lastly, cross-module comments, which refer
to comments describing dependencies across modules.

# What are red flags in comments?

Comments that repeat code are an obvious red flag as they are completely redundant.
Another red flag is when interface comments describe implementation details,
which proves the shallow nature of the abstraction.
