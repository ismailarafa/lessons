(Make it work paradigm)

# What is a tactical tornado?

A tactical tornado is a developer whom implements features quickly through aggressive tactical programming.

# What is strategic programming?

Strategic programming is the alternative to tactical programming and suggests that working code is not enough,
instead emphasizing good design as opposed to only working features. Strategic programming focuses on the long-term
resilience of the system's structure rather than short-term gains. Design flaws will pop up over time, and to program
strategically is to not sweep them under the rug but instead invest time to fix them.
