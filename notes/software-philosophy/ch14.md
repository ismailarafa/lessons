# What is the importance of naming variables well?

Good naming practices document the code and thus reduce
potential bugs. A good variable name helps the developer reading
the code think of a certain image. Good names should be precise
and consistent. Precision refers to a lack of vagueness while
consistency refers to reusing same names for similar entities.
