# What is consistency in code?

Consistency in code is crucial in reducing system complexity.
Naming, style, interfaces, invariants design patterns
are facets where consistency is key as it creates cognitive leverage
once a thing is learned, the approach is easier to extend.
This leads developers to make less mistakes.

# What are invariants?

Invariants are a property of a structure that is always true,
an example of which is each line of text being terminated
by a newline character.

# How do you ensure consistency in code?

Consistency can be ensured by setting conventions, documenting
and enforcing them. Enforcing can be done with tools that
check for violations like CI tools and manual peer code review.
Changing existing conventions is more often than not a bad idea,
better ideas are not sufficient excuse for inconsistencies.
(i.e having many conventions)
