# What is complexity?

Complexity is defined as any structural aspect of a software system that makes it harder
to understand or modify the system.

# What is change amplification?

Change amplification refers to a small change in a system causing a cascade of
other modifications in a number of places.

# What is cognitive load?

Cognitive load refers to the degree of knowledge required for a developer
in order to complete a task. Higher cognitive load means a developer needs more
time and effort to learn the necessary information. Causes of increased cognitive load
are inter-module dependencies, bloated API's, inconsistencies and global variables.

# What is an unknown unknown?

Unknonwn unknowns refer to the lack of clarity concerning a task's completion or
what information a developer must have to complete a task.

# What are causes of complexity?

Complexity mainly happens due to dependencies and obscurity. A dependency in this context
is a piece of code that cannot be understood or modified in isolation. Obscurity refers
to missing information like a generic name for a variable. Obscurity tends to produce
unknown unknowns.
