# What are the benefits of writing comments first?

Delaying writing comments after the code is written causes
comments to repeat code, renders comments obsolete or useless
since they are so far removed from the initial design. In contrast,
writing comments first as the abstraction is getting more fleshed out
leads to better comments. Secondly, it helps with system design as
the implementation evolves causing the comments to also reflect changes.
A common red flag for a method is when a method is too difficult to
describe in a comment. Writing comments first makes them more fun
in that they evolve over time as the design improves and grows,
and since the lesser words it takes to write a comment, the more
succinct the software design.
