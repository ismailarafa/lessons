# Why should code be obvious?

Obvious code is easy to read, understand and modify.
While the opposite makes the code difficult to understand,
and increases likelihood of misunderstanding it. The best way
to ensure that code is obvious is through peer code review
since code authors will be biased and see things a bit
more obviously than readers.

# What makes code obvious?

Good naming makes code more obvious since good names
provide good documentation. Consistency also makes code
more obvious since common patterns make it simpler to
understand the code.

# What makes code less obvious?

Event-driven programming and generic containers are main
causes of less obvious code. Since event handlers are not always
invoked then thorough documentation of the interface are needed
to reduce complexity and make code more obvious. Generic containers
or structures cause less obvious code since they're too generic
and methods don't describe the operations well due to their generic nature.
It is better practice to make code more obvious to avoid using
generic containers and instead write specialized classes. Code
should be written for ease of reading not ease of writing. Lastly,
code that violates user's expectations also causes nonobvious code.
