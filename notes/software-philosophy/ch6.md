# What are the benefits of a somewhat-general purpose interface?

By virtue of being adaptable, general purpose interfaces are often deep
abstractions as they contribute to better information hiding.
An interface should be general purpose enough as to avoid being shallow
but also not too abstract that they don't meet the current need.
In order to implement a general purpose abstraction, the interface
needs to be as simple as possible to meet current needs, the number of
situations a method be used needs to be determined, and lastly
the API's easy of use needs to be assessement.
