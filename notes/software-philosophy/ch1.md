# What is modular design?

Modular design enables encapsulation by dividing the system into modules to alleviate complexity.

# What is the waterfall model?

The waterfall model describes an approach to software design based on a discrete sequence of phases. Software design
ends at the design phase and thus makes software less flexible. Waterfall model is a better fit for physical systems
rather tha software systems.

# What is agile development?

Agile development focuses initial design on a small subset of the software system, enabling
incremental development of features, evaluating them, and redesigning them allowing for
a highly flexible system.
