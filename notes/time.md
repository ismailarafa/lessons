# What are **ISO**, _UTC_ and **Unix timestamps**?

**UNIX time** is how a Mac computer counts time in second increments in 32-bit numbers. It started counting from Thursday, January 1, 1970\. Inevitably, it will run out of time on January 19th, 2038 when it reaches its ceiling, overflowing and taking its count to negative. **ISO time** is a standard by the International Organization for Standardization covering the exchange of date and time-related data. It's based on the Gregorian calendar and the 24-hour timekeeping system with optional timezone information, time intervals and other combinations. Examples of **ISO time** are below.

Furthermore, _UTC time_ is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. It doesn't observe daylight saving time and is a close related successor to GMT. It started first on 1 January 1960.
