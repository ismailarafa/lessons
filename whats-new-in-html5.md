Semantic tags define meaning or how the content should appear on a page. HTML5 introduced several new semantic tags to define the meaning and how the content looks. The new tags are <article>, <aside>, <details>, <figcaption>, <figure>, <footer>, <header>, <main>, <mark>, <nav>, <section>, <summary>, <time>.

One of the new tags in HTML5 is the <canvas> tag, which is a section or rather a rectangle on the page in which you can use JavaScript to draw anything from graphics, to game graphics to other interactive visual images.

<canvas> is infinitely amazing because it opens up a whole can of interactivity in the middle of your webpage.

The new video control features through the new <video> tag circumvent the cumbersome former necessity of a third-party involvement (i.e QuickTime or Flash player) and uses controls from the browser itself to control playback, volume and a timecode, as well as a seeker. The controls even work on mobile phone browsers should they support HTML5, as for browsers that don't, they just ignore the <video> tag altogether. You can add a caption file with .vtt extension with a <track> tag nested in the <video> element, usually after the src attribute(s) is/are specified. More attributes include preload which downloads the video when the page loads without playing it, while preload="none" does not download the video when the page loads.

Local storage is an HTML5 storage concept that gives web sites the ability to store data on your computer for later retrieval, theoretically it's similar to cookies, but practically, the data is much larger in quantity. Whereas cookies are small and limited in size, and are sent by the browser back to the server with each page request, HTML5 storage lives on your computer and web sites can access it with JavaScript after loading the page.

<audio> is a new media element in HTML5, it uses a browser's default controls which are similar to a <video> tag's controls. Just like <video>, it can have several attributes, some of which are autoplay (plays upon the page being loaded without showing the controls), controls (which shows a seeker, timecode, a play/pause button and volume control, and the loop attribute which loops the content when the page loads. Moreover, height and width can be specified for either <video> or <audio> elements.

Data attributes are used to store private data specific to a page or application. They are similar to classes or id's, exist in the opening tags of elements and their syntax is as follows (i.e data-birds="hummingbird") the "birds" defines the attribute name and is always prefixed by date-, its attribute value follows the name after an = sign. Data attributes can be passed from back-end to front-end through using the data name not the value.

With the advent of HTML5, arose several compatibility and performance trade-offs. Some older as well as current versions of browsers don't support some of the new features, elements or tags in HTML5. A browser would simply ignore the tags or elements in question when displaying a page. Moreover, performance could be adversely affected in that the features won't render as they are intended or won't play as they are. With the new <audio> and <video> tags arose the problem of format compatibility with different browsers, this can be subverted through linking all formats of video and audio in the code for the page to effectively load the media as it's intended.
