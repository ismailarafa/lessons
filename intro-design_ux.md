# What is _design_?

_Design_ is a method of problem solving and communication. It's the way in which information is effectively and efficiently presented. Good _design_ is intuitive and seamless, combines **UX** and _UI_ effortlessly and innovatively.

## What is **user experience**?

**UX** or **user experience** is a part of _design_ encapsulating aspects of graphic design, psychology among a range of disciplines, its goal is to imprint a lasting impression on the user, catering to their needs and giving them an interactive and memorable experience.

## What's the difference between **UX** and _UI_?

_UI_ and **UX** are similar, in that their aim is smoothening a user's interactive experience with the product. _UI_ can be part of **UX** in some cases. _UI_ is an interface that doesn't draw any attention to itself besides servicing the user. It makes a user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible. Whereas, **UX** is a broader concept encompassing a larger scope of purposes and potentially including _UI_ as part of the **user's experience**.

### What are the primary aspects **UX** focuses on?

**UX** focuses primarily on _visual design_, **information architecture**, and **_interaction design_**, and _usability_ they all work in tandem to ensure a **user's experience** is effective, simple, satisfying, innovative and memorable. _Visual design_ concerns the aesthetic aspect of **UX** and helps establish context along with **information architecture**, which groups pertinent sections of content accordingly. Moreover, _usability_ ensures that the _website_ is accessible, and intuitive to navigate for **all** users. **_Interaction design_** is potentially related to _UI_ in that it's the creation of an interactive platform for the user that is both friendly and highly efficient.

### What is the **visual hierarchy** and why is it important for _websites_?

**Visual hierarchy** is an important principle of **UX**, and it's the way in which content is visually represented, taking into account how the user perceives the content and subsequently directing them through experiencing the content. A good **visual hierarchy** is crucial for _websites_ as they establish order, context and guide the user to consume the content in a seamless and effective manner.

#### What are the primary ways to achieve **visual hierarchy**?

The primary ways to achieve **visual hierarchy** are through color, size,the **CRAP factors**, texture, whitespace, style among other factors.

##### What is the **design hierarchy pyramid**?

The **design hierarchy pyramid** has five components, and they are from top to bottom, _creativity_, **intellectuality**,**_usability_**, _reliability_ and **functionality**. **Functionality** is the foundational piece and thus the most important, it concerns the basics of the design and that it's fundamentally functional. Secondly, _reliability_ ensures that its performance is stable. Thirdly, **_usability_** comes in making sure that the design is simple enough to use. Moreover,**intellectuality** or engagement is where the design impels people to do more. Lastly, _creativity_ involves the aesthetic value and the surface level presentation of the design.

### What are the **CRAP factors** of effective _layout_ and what are they used for?

The **CRAP factors** are namely **Contrast**, _Repetition_, _Alignment_ and **_Proximity_**. The first is namely about difference, whether through colors, text, fonts, shapes, sizes, etc...a user perceiving **contrast**, keeps them engaged and helps avoid confusion if the _layout_ is too monotonous. _Repetition_ is the opposite of contrast, in that it provides a sense of continuity by subtly repeating features or elements in the _layout_. _Alignment_ concerns how elements in a _layout_ appear visually connected. A _layout's_ elements' placement should look purposeful and feel visually _aligned_ or related. **_Proximity_** pertains more to how close or far a _layout's_ elements are away from one another.
